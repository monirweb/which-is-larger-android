# which number is larger ?

You have only 20 seconds to gain coins! The more you answer correctly , the more coins you get.
This game has 3 buttons.Two for random numbers which are generated by `generateInt()` and set to buttons with`generateNumberToNextLevel()` method.
And another button for equal numbers condition.
If your answer is correct,animation of coin plays which is `coin_scale.xml` and you will gain coin.
We used `CountDownTimer` class to start time from 20 to 0.
If the time finished, the animation `clock_scale.xml` would start.
